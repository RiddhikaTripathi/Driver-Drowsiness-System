# Driver-Drowsiness-System
# Problem Statement
Feeling drowsy and tired during long drives at night is very common specially for transportation purposes, but did you know that it can be extremely dangerous? Driver drowsiness is a serious issue plaguing the transportation industry. The long hours on the road, coupled with the monotony of the job, can lead to fatigue and ultimately, accidents. According to recent statistics, driver drowsiness is responsible for a significant number of accidents on our highways, resulting in injuries and even fatalities.
Problem Description:
Drivers experiencing drowsiness, fatigue, or distraction behind the wheel often exhibit specific physiological signs, such as slow eye blinking, yawning, or head nodding. Recognizing these indicators in a timely manner is crucial for alerting the driver and preventing potential accidents.
Objective:
Develop a driver drowsiness detection system that uses computer vision and rule-based analysis to identify specific facial cues indicating drowsiness. The system should provide real-time alerts to the driver, ensuring increased safety by prompting necessary breaks or interventions.
Impact:
This system aims to contribute to road safety by actively detecting and addressing instances of driver drowsiness, potentially reducing the number of accidents caused by this preventable issue.
Challenge:
The challenge lies in creating an accurate, reliable system that effectively detects signs of drowsiness while ensuring minimal false alerts to prevent unnecessary distractions to the driver.
